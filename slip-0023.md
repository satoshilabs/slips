## Abstract

This specification describes how to derive the master node, aka root node, of the key tree in Cardano hierarchical deterministic wallets.

## Motivation

Cryptocurrency wallets generally work by combining a [BIP-0039](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) mnemonic or a set of [SLIP-0039](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0039.md) mnemonics with a user-entered passphrase to generate a master seed. This master seed is then used to derive a hierarchy of cryptographic keys as defined in [BIP-0032](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) and [SLIP-0010](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0010.md).

Cardano hierarchical deterministic wallets use an extended private key which requires them to implement a custom adaptation of the BIP-0032 child key derivation scheme. The Cardano wallets currently in existence implement several mutually incompatible schemes for the derivation of the master node from a BIP-0039 mnemonic and passphrase. Unfortunately all of these derivation schemes fail to separate the derivation of the seed from the derivation of the key tree, making it impossible to integrate them with new seed derivation schemes. This specification aims to rectify this by defining a new scheme for the derivation of the master node from a seed. The new scheme is primarily intended for use with SLIP-0039 Shamir's Secret-Sharing for Mnemonic Codes.

## Cardano universal master node derivation

This scheme adapts the master node derivation used in BIP-0032 and SLIP-0010 by defining a new curve name "ed25519 cardano seed" for the Ed25519 curve with the Cardano deterministic key hierarchy. The curve name is used as salt in BIP-0032 and SLIP-0010 when deriving the master node from the seed. This is necessary to ensure proper domain separation between different elliptic curves or different types of key hierarchies. The root extended private key (*k*<sub>L</sub>,&nbsp;*k*<sub>R</sub>) is computed by taking the SHA-512 hash of the root private key *I*<sub>L</sub>, modifying certain bits to make it a valid EdDSA key and clearing the third highest bit of *k*<sub>L</sub> to ensure compatibility with Cardano child key derivation.

1. Let *S* be a seed byte sequence such as the master secret from SLIP-0039.
2. Calculate *I* := HMAC-SHA512(Key = "ed25519 cardano seed", Data = *S*).
3. Split *I* into two 32-byte sequences, *I*<sub>L</sub> := *I*[0:32] and *I*<sub>R</sub> := *I*[32:64].
4. Let *k* := SHA-512(*I*<sub>L</sub>).
5. Modify *k* by assigning *k*[0] := *k*[0] & 0xf8 and *k*[31] := (*k*[31] & 0x1f) | 0x40.
6. Interpret *k*[0:32] as a 256-bit integer *k*<sub>L</sub> in little-endian byte order. Let *k*<sub>R</sub> := *k*[32:64] and use (*k*<sub>L</sub>,&nbsp;*k*<sub>R</sub>) as the root extended private key and *c* := *I*<sub>R</sub> as the root chain code.

## Cardano Icarus master node derivation

The Icarus master node derivation scheme, aka V2 derivation scheme, is commonly used with BIP-0039 in Cardano wallets. Since there does not exist any specification of this scheme, its description is included below for completeness.

1. Let *M* be a BIP-0039 mnemonic and *P* the passphrase entered by the user.
2. Determine the initial entropy *E* that was used to generate *M*.
3. Compute *S* := PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512(password = *P*, salt = *E*, iterations = 4096, dkLen = 96).
4. Modify *S* by assigning *S*[0] := *S*[0] & 0xf8 and *S*[31] := (*S*[31] & 0x1f) | 0x40.
5. Interpret *S*[0:32] as a 256-bit integer *k*<sub>L</sub> in little-endian byte order. Let *k*<sub>R</sub> := *S*[32:64] and use (*k*<sub>L</sub>,&nbsp;*k*<sub>R</sub>) as the root extended private key and *c* := *S*[64:96] as the root chain code.

## Child key derivation

The derivation of child keys in the Cardano deterministic key hierarchy is specified in [BIP32-Ed25519](https://doi.org/10.1109/EuroSPW.2017.47) and also described in the [Cardano documentation](https://github.com/input-output-hk/technical-docs/blob/main/cardano-components/cardano-wallet/doc/Wallet-Cryptography-and-Encoding.md#hierarchical-deterministic-wallets).

## Compliance

When SLIP-0039 is used as the source of the master secret the master node for the Cardano deterministic key hierarchy MUST be derived using the Cardano universal master node derivation scheme as specified [above](#cardano-universal-master-node-derivation).

When BIP-0039 is used as the source of the master secret the master node for the Cardano deterministic key hierarchy SHOULD be derived using the Cardano Icarus master node derivation scheme to maintain compatibility with existing wallets.

## Test vectors

In the following test vectors the values of *S*, *k*<sub>R</sub>, *A* and *c* are each encoded as a string containing two hexadecimal digits for each byte. The value of *k*<sub>L</sub> is encoded as an integer in base 10.
