## Abstract

This document describes a method for implementing Elliptic Curve
Diffie-Hellman algorithm, using a determinstic hierarchy.

## Motivation

Using Deterministic Hierarchy for encryption and decryption is ideal,
because the same concepts of easy backup that relate to backing up
deterministic wallets can be applied to backing up private keys.

## Service Identity

Let's introduce the service identity. It consists of two elements:

a) RFC 3986 URI `proto://[user@]host[:port][/path]`

Examples:

* `https://example.com`
* `ftp://public@example.com/pub`
* `ssh://root@example.com:2222`

b) index (32-bit unsigned integer)

The index is used so one can generate more keys corresponding to the same URI.

## HD Structure

1. First concatenate `index` with the URI (`uri`). Use little endian for `index`.

2. Compute the SHA256 hash of the result (`hash`).

3. Truncate `hash` to 128 bits (`hash128`)

4. Split `hash128` into four 32-bit integers `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`. Use little endian for each.

5. Set highest bits of numbers `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` to 1 (e.g. logical OR with 0x80000000) to harden

6. Derive the HD node `m/17'/A'/B'/C'/D'` according to BIP32.

## Shared secret generation

Suppose that Alice and Bob need to agree on a shared secret.

First, they agree on a specific elliptic curve and generate
two public keys: `P1 = k1*G` for Alice and `P2 = k2*G` for Bob.

In order to derive a shared secret, Alice retrieves Bob's public key (P2).
Then, she calls `Q = GetECDHSessionKey(P2)` API on her TREZOR, to compute
`Q = k1*P2`, by multiplying Bob's public key `P2` (as an elliptic curve point)
by her private key `k1` (as a 256-bit scalar).

The result is the elliptic curve point `Q = k1*k2*P`, which can be computed in a
similar way by Bob (since `Q = k2*P1`), is used to derive a shared secret.
