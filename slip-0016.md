## Abstract

SLIP-0016 describes simple encryption concept for hardware device for secure storage of passwords.

## General design

At first, we derive a master key from HW device itself, which is divided in two parts.
First part is hashed and used as a name of storage file.
Second part is used for primary storage encryption.

Storage file is encrypted JSON object, which contains configuration, tags and separate entries. Each entry has other two encrypted properties derivated from  device to provide higher level of security with low risk of leaks.

## Design details

### Deriving master key

We derive masterKey from hardware device by sending cipherKeyValue with following params:

* path: `m/10016'/0` (hardened path, see BIP32)
* ENC_KEY: `'Unlock encrypted storage?'` (max length message is 256 bytes)
* ENC_VALUE: `'2d650551248d792eabf628f451200d7f51cb63e46aadcbb1038aacb05e8c8aee2d650551248d792eabf628f451200d7f51cb63e46aadcbb1038aacb05e8c8aee'` (in hexadecimal (128 /2), max length is 1024 bytes)
* encrypt: `true`
* ask_on_encrypt: `true`
* ask_on_decrypt: `true`
* iv: unset

JS EXAMPLE:

```javascript
session.cipherKeyValue(
[(10016 | 0x80000000) >>> 0, 0],
'Unlock encrypted storage?',
'2d650551248d792eabf628f451200d7f51cb63e46aadcbb1038aacb05e8c8aee2d650551248d792eabf628f451200d7f51cb63e46aadcbb1038aacb05e8c8aee',
true, true, true)
```

CipherKeyValue is defined in [SLIP-0011](slip-0011.md).

### Deriving file name

From the first half of master key, we derive the file name for every user/device in the following way:
First, we use the HMAC function:

`HMAC-SHA256(fileKey, FILENAME_MESS)`

where:

- fileKey is the first half of masterKey (`masterKey.substring(0, masterKey.length / 2)`)
- FILENAME_MESS is a constant string `'5f91add3fa1c3c76e90c90a3bd0999e2bd7833d06a483fe884ee60397aca277a'`

The output result is digested to HEX string. After, we append extension `'.pswd'`

EXAMPLE RESULT: `a80387a2222f4360f71fd2165368c6ed91b26287d9bc1ce8be71e64e6b216a4f.pswd`

### Deriving encryption key and file level encryption

As an encryption key is used the SECOND half (32 bytes) of master key for the first level of data file encryption. Encryption key is in HEX string.

For encrypt/decrypt we are using `AES-256-GCM` algorithm.

- Input Vector (IV) is 12 randomly generated bytes
- GCM is used with full 128-bit autentication tag (authTag)

[more info](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_createcipheriv_algorithm_key_iv)

The result output stored in file is:

- first 12 bytes of the file is randomly generated IV
- next 16 bytes is the GCM authTag
- the rest is output ciphertext

[more info](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_createdecipheriv_algorithm_key_iv)

### Data format

(Decrypted) data file is serialized JSON object with the following keys:

* `version`: for future backwards compatibility and data storage manipulation
* `config`: for remembering personal setup of application
* `tags`: contain set of labels with their icons (from icomoon set). Default tag is **All** and it is only tag, unable to edit or delete.

```javascript
{title:"My social networks", icon:"person", active:"active"}
```

* `entries`: is object of all password entries encrypted second time

```javascript
{
    "title": "http://wwww.github.com",
    "username": "Satoshi Nakamoto",
    "nonce": "8688105887642a3cbb61889d8762432ef864df107e097d2b19e93c8d808c2e21",
    "note": "public note",
    "password": {},
    "safe_note": {},
    "tags": [1]
}
```

### Entry level encryption

Every entry contains keys from upper example.

- `title`: title is represented as string. If given string is matching URL, it will be shown on device as domain without protocol prefix.
- `username`: string, will be passed to device, in encryption/decryption process
- `nonce`: hidden generated string which is output of cipherKeyValue over Title + Username key and random values
- `password`: is buffer array output of plain string and nonce (encryption process described later)
- `safe_note`: is also buffer array output of plain string and nonce (also described later)
- `note`: is plain UTF8 string
- `tags`: is array of Tags key values

Step by step entry encryption:

1. Generate random 32 bytes buffer and convert to HEX string inadequately called `nonce`
2. Set key as `'Unlock ' + title + ' for user ' + username + '?'`
3. Ask device for `cipherKeyValue`, where path is the same as in the deriving file name, key is described in second step and enc_value is our `nonce` from the first step. Do not forget to setup properly other three bool values!

EXAMPLE:

```javascript
session.cipherKeyValue(
[(10016 | 0x80000000) >>> 0, 0], // same path
'Unlock github.com for user Satoshi Nakamoto?',
'2d650551248d792eabf628f451200d7f51cb63e46aadcbb1038aacb05e8c8aee2d650551248d792eabf628f451200d7f51cb63e46aadcbb1038aacb05e8c8aee',
true,   //encrypt? - has to be TRUE in encryption
false,  //askOnEncrypt? is the same in encryption and decryption
true) // askOnDecrypt? we want this becuase otherwise somebody could rob us!
```

4. Then we use our famous `nonce` from the first step in `AES-256-GCM` algorithm encryption for `password` string and `safe_note` string. Process of encryption is the same as in the deriving encryption key and file level encryption. So basically we get some Buffer array output with 12 bytes of IV and 16 bytes of GCM authTag and the rest is cipherText.
5. Output of each encryption is stored to appropriate keys, just instead of generated `nonce` we store result from third step ( `cipherKeyValue`) which we later use for decryption process

### Entry decryption

1. We ask device for the same  `cipherKeyValue` as in encryption process, just instead of  `nonce`, we use our encrypted result and boolean value  `encrypt?` is **false**!

EXAMPLE:

```javascript
session.cipherKeyValue(
[(10016 | 0x80000000) >>> 0, 0], // same path
'Unlock github.com for user Satoshi Nakamoto?',
'8688105887642a3cbb61889d8762432ef864df107e097d2b19e93c8d808c2e21',
false,   //encrypt? - has to be FALSE in decryption
false,  //askOnEncrypt? is the same in encryption and decryption
true) // askOnDecrypt? we want this becuase otherwise somebody could rob us!
```

2. Other steps are the same as in entry encryption, we just symetrically decrypt values of `password` and  `safe_note` via `AES-256-GCM` algorithm. Size of IV and authTag for AES is the same as in encryption. Beware on cipher Key data type - it must be hex. Output is in JSON.

Check example of password reader implementation in python [pwdreader.py](slip-0016/pwdreader.py) there is an example code for decryption.


### V2.0.0 format - discussion/suggestions

The following proposed changes will make the password manager usable in `offline mode` (for accessing non-online services like credit card's PIN or a safebox's combination) and sync the passwords with different services such as FTP, owncloud,...

Imagine that we agreed on allowing `"offline access"` to the passwords (you could store the file in the SD card slot of TREZOR v2 or the storage on a mobile device), it comes with a problem on how to sync the entries, you could made some changes offline and when you try to sync, discover that the remote has changed too. In this case, we could offer the user some solutions:
1. Ask the user which file to use, and which to discard (completely). Pros: easiest to the user. Cons: We might lose data.
2. `Merge` the files, going entry by entry, if username+item match ask the user which entry to keep
3. `Merge` the files, going entry by entry, if username+item match, decrypt both password and check them too, ask the user which entry to keep.

For 2 and 3 we do not match the title, as it might be different (github vs github.com) but item and username should be equal. For solution 1, we should add a `mod_date` (timestamp of last modification) field to the file's configuration. For 2 and 3, we should add it to each entry. I think the better solution for the user is 2, complete enough without being too annoying. User will be presented a choice "Those two entries looks similar [Entry A - date 1] and [Entry B - date 2], what would you like to do? Keep them both - Keep A - Keep B".

Another suggestion is to add the `services` field to the main file, or maybe inside `config`. The purpose of this field is to hold information of servers and services that will allow the user to store their data. Dropbox or drive do not require that kind of field, but someone may be interested in syncing their data with their own FTP server, an owncloud server or even store it as a draft on a mail server. Not every application should or would be compatible with every `service`. Chrome extension may be only allow dropbox integration, but more advanced users who want to set up some other services could use other applications. User could set up one or more services at the same time, and be able to sync with them at wish. Services should contain at least a `title` to identify them (ie: "Personal FTP", "OwnCloud server",...)and a `type` (ie: "ftp", "owncloud", ...) among other fields that are "type-specific" (server, port, username,...) and also encrypt some information if needed (password). We could use the message: `'Sync data with ' + title + '?'` for encryption/decryption purposes.

Application specific configuration should be also be under their own section under `config`, or maybe under `config.apps`. For example:
 ```
 ...
 config: {
   chrome-extension: {
     copy_clipboard:disabled,
     ...     
   },
   mobile: {
     offline: false,
     autologin: true,
     ...     
   },  
   desktop: {
     fullscreen: true,
     ...     
   },  
 }
 ...
 ```

Lastly, we need to made some changes, as right now the `title` is being used as `item`, and `note` as `title`, we should add a new field to entry's format `item` or `URI`, which will be the URI for the online service (ie: http://www.github.com), `title` would be the title of the site (ie: Github) and note would be a short text (ie: Do not deploy code on Friday's afternoon). While I'm not sure how many people will use the `note` field since there's already a `safe_note` one, it might be useful in some cases to specify more information about the entry without decrypting it.

To upgrade, the application will detect an old format file and ask the user to upgrade to a new one (explaining the risks maybe?). It will decrypt the file, re-arrange the fields (title, item, note) and save it, no need to decrypt each entry in this change. Old file could be saved too under a different name (xxxxx.pswd_bck ??) in case something went wrong.
