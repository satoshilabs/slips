Title:   Registered human-readable parts for BIP-0173
Type:    Standard

## Abstract

BIP-0173 defines a new format for segregated witness output addresses that contains a human-readable part that identifies the coin type.

## Motivation

The BIP repository does not want to deal with assigning the values for various coin types different than Bitcoin so we propose this SLIP to become such body.

## Registered human-readable parts

These are the registered human-readable parts for usage in Bech32 encoding of witness programs.
