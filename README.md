# SatoshiLabs Improvement Proposals

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/satoshilabs/slips.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/satoshilabs/slips)

SatoshiLabs projects need a way how to document their technical decisions and features.
For some of them Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) is not a right place because
their range and implications are outside of the scope of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

SLIP repository is an extension to Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process
and contains the documents that are unsuitable for submission to BIP repository.

Each SLIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.
